> This page shows you **exactly** how to open and use our notebooks in **Google Colab** (or locally in Jupyter). It includes direct links and plain‑English guidance. If you’ve never touched Python before, you’re in the right place.

## Quick links

**Open the notebooks directly in Colab:**

- **Introduction Notebook**  
  [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ggkuhnle/fb2nep-epi/blob/main/howto_sandbox/Introduction-Notebook.ipynb) · [View on GitHub](https://github.com/ggkuhnle/fb2nep-epi/blob/main/howto_sandbox/Introduction-Notebook.ipynb)

- **Playground (Sandbox)**  
  [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ggkuhnle/fb2nep-epi/blob/main/howto_sandbox/Playground.ipynb) · [View on GitHub](https://github.com/ggkuhnle/fb2nep-epi/blob/main/howto_sandbox/Playground.ipynb)

**Printable cheat‑sheet:**  
- [python‑cheatsheet.md](python-cheatsheet.md) (open “Raw”, then save/print)

## How to open a notebook in Colab (step‑by‑step)

1. Click an **Open in Colab** button above. Colab will load the notebook from GitHub.  
2. At the top‑right, click **Connect** if it isn’t already connected. This starts a fresh, temporary Python session (a “runtime”).  
3. You may see a warning like **“This notebook was not authored by Google.”**  
   - Click **Run anyway**. Our notebooks are plain text and safe to run.  
4. You might also see **“Warning: This notebook requires permissions to run.”**  
   - Click **Run anyway**. Colab sandboxes code; nothing runs on your computer.  
5. To **run a cell**, click the small ▶ button on its left, or press **Shift + Enter**.  
6. To **run every cell from top to bottom**, go to **Runtime → Run all**.  
7. To **save your own editable copy**, go to **File → Save a copy in Drive**. You now have a personal copy you can edit freely.

### Useful Colab options
- **Runtime → Restart runtime** resets the session if things get stuck.  
- **Runtime → Change runtime type** (we use Python 3; **no GPU needed**).  
- **File → Download** lets you save the executed notebook as `.ipynb` or PDF.

## Working locally in Jupyter (optional)
If you prefer local execution:
1. Install **Anaconda** or **Miniconda**, then open **Jupyter Lab**.  
2. Download the `.ipynb` files from GitHub and open them in Jupyter Lab.  
3. Run cells with **Shift + Enter** as in Colab.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **ModuleNotFoundError** (e.g. `statsmodels`): run the cell that starts with `!pip install ...`, then **Runtime → Restart runtime**, and re‑run the code.  
- **Kernel crashed / out of memory**: restart the runtime. Don’t open huge datasets in this sandbox.  
- **Long‑running cells**: click the stop icon (■) next to the cell number, or **Runtime → Interrupt execution**.

## What you’ll learn here

- How to run Python cells safely in the cloud (Colab).  
- How to make small edits and immediately see their effect.  
- How to generate simple synthetic data and make basic plots & analyses you’ll reuse in FB2NEP.

Now jump into the **Introduction Notebook** first, then play in the **Playground**.
