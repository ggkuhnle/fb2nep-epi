# Assessment 2 – Public health intervention pitch

## Objective

> This assessment evaluates your ability to translate epidemiological evidence into a coherent and plausible public health intervention. You will propose an intervention aimed at reducing harm related to sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) intake and communicate your proposal clearly to a non-technical audience.

### Background

You are working as a junior researcher analysing observational data from a population-based study investigating associations between sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) intake, obesity, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk.

Before any statistical analysis is conducted, the research team must make a number of substantive epidemiological decisions: how SSB intake should be estimated, what types of bias and censoring might arise, which variables plausibly confound the relationship of interest, and how causal relationships should be conceptualised.

Section A of this assessment reflects this early analytical phase. You should answer the questions as if you were planning or reviewing a real-world epidemiological analysis, drawing on standard principles from nutritional epidemiology rather than on the specifics of the teaching dataset.

Section B then represents the analytical phase, in which these ideas are explored using a realistic synthetic dataset provided for teaching purposes. The dataset is designed to mimic the structure and challenges of real observational nutrition data, while allowing each student to work with an individual dataset.

Across both sections, the emphasis is on epidemiological reasoning and interpretation, not on finding a single “correct” numerical answer.

## Use of artificial intelligence

The use of artificial intelligence tools (including generative AI for scripting, visuals, narration, or editing) is **strictly prohibited** in this assessment. All content must be your own work.

## What you must submit

* A recorded presentation of approximately **7 minutes**.
* A single file or link uploaded via the submission system.

There is **no prescribed format**. Any presentation style is acceptable (for example slides with narration, talking head, animation, performance-based formats), provided it communicates a clear public health intervention proposal.

---

## Task

Design and present a pitch for a public health intervention that addresses SSB intake and cardiometabolic risk.

Your presentation should clearly address:

* The public health problem and its relevance
* The proposed intervention and its rationale
* The target population and setting
* Feasibility and implementation considerations
* Expected benefits and possible unintended consequences

## Marking rubric and assessment criteria

Marks are awarded for **content, reasoning, and clarity**, not production quality or format choice.

* **Problem definition:** Clear articulation of the public health issue, grounded in evidence
* **Intervention rationale:** Logical and evidence-informed justification
* **Target population:** Clear and appropriate definition
* **Feasibility:** Consideration of practicality, barriers, and implementation
* **Public health impact:** Discussion of expected benefits and potential harms
* **Communication quality:** Clear, coherent, and engaging communication, regardless of format

### Mark descriptors

* **70–100 (Excellent):** Compelling, well-reasoned intervention grounded in evidence and clearly communicated.
* **60–69 (Good):** Coherent proposal with reasonable justification and clarity.
* **50–59 (Adequate):** Basic proposal with limited depth or critical engagement.
* **<50 (Poor):** Unclear, unrealistic, or poorly justified proposal.
