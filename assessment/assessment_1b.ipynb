    "- It generates a **personal synthetic dataset** for you, without requiring any manual input.\n",
    "- It guides you through:\n",
    "  - Creating a baseline characteristics table (\"Table 1\").\n",
    "  - Exploring distributions and considering transformations.\n",
    "  - Fitting a regression model relating sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) intake, obesity and CVD risk.\n",
    "  - Obtaining output that you can copy into your Word document.\n",
    "\n",
    "You do **not** need to understand Python code to complete this notebook. In most cases, you only need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Record the automatically generated **Population name**.\n",
    "2. Run the code cells in order (top to bottom).\n",
    "3. Copy selected tables and figures into your Word document.\n",
    "4. Answer the questions in your own words in the Word document.\n",
    "\n",
