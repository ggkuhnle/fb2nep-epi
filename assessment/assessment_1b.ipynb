    "- It generates a **personal synthetic dataset** for you, without requiring any manual input.\n",
    "- It guides you through:\n",
    "  - Creating a baseline characteristics table (\"Table 1\").\n",
    "  - Exploring distributions and considering transformations.\n",
    "  - Fitting a regression model relating sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) intake, obesity and CVD risk.\n",
    "  - Obtaining output that you can copy into your Word document.\n",
    "\n",
    "You do **not** need to understand Python code to complete this notebook. In most cases, you only need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Record the automatically generated **Population name**.\n",
    "2. Run the code cells in order (top to bottom).\n",
    "3. Copy selected tables and figures into your Word document.\n",
