## Coursework assignment

### Title

**Sugar-sweetened beverages, obesity, and cardiovascular risk: a synthetic cohort analysis**

### Components

The assignment consists of two interlinked parts:

1. **Part A – Concepts and causal reasoning**
   - Short knowledge questions.
   - Drawing and explaining a directed acyclic graph (DAG).
   - Interpretation of results from a published epidemiological study.

2. **Part B – Guided data analysis (using a personal synthetic dataset)**
   - Generation of an individual dataset in Google Colab (per–student random seed).
   - Construction of a baseline characteristics table (“Table 1”).
   - Exploration of distributions and consideration of transformations.
   - Fitting and interpreting a regression model relating SSB intake, obesity, and CVD risk.
   - Linking model specification to the DAG from Part A.
   - Optional bonus: exploration of interaction or non–linear effects.

You will complete the analysis in a **Google Colab notebook** and transfer selected tables and figures into your Word document, where you provide your written answers.
