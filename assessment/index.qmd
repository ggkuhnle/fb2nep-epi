## Welcome

This site contains the core learning materials for **FB2NEP: Nutritional Epidemiology and Public Health**.

You will mainly work through the notebooks in this repository. Use Blackboard for timetables, announcements, and assessment submission links.

## Assessments

Assessment is by **coursework only** and consists of **two assessments**:

- [**Assessment 1:**](assessment_1.qmd) Data analysis and written interpretation (using a personal synthetic dataset).
- [**Assessment 2:**](assessment_2.qmd) A **7-minute recorded presentation** pitching a public health intervention.


## Use of AI tools

Use of generative AI is **not permitted** for any part of the module assessments. This includes (but is not limited to):

- generating, rewriting, paraphrasing, translating, summarising, or structuring text;
- generating code, analyses, tables, figures, or slide content;
- “checking” or “improving” your work, even if you believe the output is only editorial.

You may use standard software for writing and analysis (for example LaTeX, pandoc, Word, PowerPoint, Excel, R, Python/Colab), but the intellectual work, analysis decisions, interpretation, and wording must be entirely your own.
