    "# Introduction to Nutritional Epidemiology - FB2NEP (Part 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the Nutritional Epidemiology part of FB2NEP. In the *nutritional epidemiology* part, we will use **Jupyter notebooks** to **demonstrate and explain key concepts in nutritional epidemiology** and to **work through small, realistic examples** step by step.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You can **run the code, edit it, and re-run it** to see how changes affect the results—an ideal way to practise methods you will use in assignments and perhaps even your own projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "These notebooks are stored in a **shared, read-only repository**, so you **cannot accidentally overwrite or damage** the original files. Please feel free to **experiment, modify code, and explore** --- this is the best way to learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To save your own work:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- In **Google Colab**, go to *File → Save a copy in Drive*.  \n",

    "## Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Jupyter Notebook** is an interactive environment that lets you combine **code, text, images, and visualisations** in a single, shareable document. They are widely used in science, education, and data analysis because they make it easy to **run code step-by-step**, document your process, and share reproducible results.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a Jupyter Notebook:\n",
    "- Each **cell** can contain either **Python code** or **Markdown text**.\n",
    "- You can run code one cell at a time — this helps you experiment and explore data interactively.\n",
    "- The **output** (tables, plots, or text) appears directly below the code that generated it.\n",
    "- Markdown cells (like this one) are used for explanations, instructions, and formatting.\n",

    "- **2001 — IPython begins:** Fernando Pérez starts **IPython**, an enhanced interactive Python shell for scientific computing.  \n",
    "- **2011 — IPython Notebook:** A browser-based, document-centred interface appears (the `.ipynb` format), letting users mix code, text and outputs.  \n",
    "- **2014 — Project Jupyter announced:** The project becomes **language-agnostic** and separates from IPython’s Python-only core. The name “Jupyter” nods to **Ju**lia, **Py**thon and **R**. The **kernel** architecture and **messaging protocol** enable many languages to run in notebooks.  \n",
    "- **2015–2017 — Ecosystem grows:** Tools like **JupyterHub** (multi-user servers for classes/labs) and **nbconvert** (exporting notebooks) mature; **Binder/mybinder.org** appears for shareable, reproducible environments.  \n",
    "- **2018–2021 — JupyterLab era:** **JupyterLab**, a more flexible, IDE-like interface, moves from beta to stable and continues to evolve; the classic Notebook interface remains available.  \n",
    "- **Today:** Jupyter supports dozens of languages via kernels (R, Julia, Python, and many more), powers education and research, and sits at the centre of many reproducible data-science workflows.\n",
