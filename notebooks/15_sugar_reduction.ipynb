    "\n",
    "### A Common Misconception\n",
    "\n",
    "It is often stated that sugar intake cannot be measured with a biomarker. **This is incorrect.**\n",
    "\n",
    "A validated biomarker for total sugars intake exists:\n",
    "- **24-hour urinary sucrose + fructose** (Tasevska et al., 2005)\n",
    "- Validated in controlled feeding studies\n",
    "- Successfully used in EPIC-Norfolk and Health Survey for England\n",
    "\n",
    "### So Why Hasn't It Been Used?\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike the UK salt reduction programme, which incorporated regular biomarker monitoring, sugar reduction policies have **not** routinely used the urinary sugars biomarker. This is largely due to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Logistical challenges**: 24-hour urine collection is burdensome\n",
    "2. **Cost**: Laboratory analysis at population scale is expensive\n",
    "3. **Historical timing**: The biomarker was validated (2005) but sugar policy only became a priority later (2015+)\n",
    "4. **Policy design**: SDIL focused on reformulation, not population intake monitoring\n",
    "\n",
    "This represents a **missed opportunity** for objective evaluation."
