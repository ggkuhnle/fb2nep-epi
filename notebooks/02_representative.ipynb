    "# FB2NEP — Sampling, Representativeness, and Bias\n",
    "\n",
    "**Date:** 09 November 2025\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook introduces core ideas in sampling for nutritional epidemiology: the difference between the **general population**, a **study's target (sample) population**, and an actual **study sample**; common **recruitment biases**; and approaches to **addressing bias** (e.g., post-stratification weights). We will simulate data to compare well-known United States cohorts (by design archetype) with a United States reference survey (NHANES-like), and demonstrate how bias can distort estimates and how weighting can partially correct them.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** The cohort labels below are illustrative archetypes (e.g., “NHS-like”, “HPFS-like”, “WHI-like”), generated using simulated data for teaching purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning outcomes\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, students should be able to:\n",
    "- Distinguish clearly between **general population**, **sample population**, and **study sample**.\n",
    "- Explain what **representativeness** means and why it matters for inference.\n",
    "- Identify typical **recruitment biases** (e.g., “worried well”, sex imbalance, education skew).\n",
    "- Apply simple **post-stratification (weighting)** to address imbalance and evaluate its effect.\n",
    "- Compare large observational studies to the general public and discuss **under-representation**.\n",
    "- Reflect on what this means **globally**, including issues of transferability beyond the US.\n",
    "- Discuss why a global multi-country study may fail when using **US-centric dietary assessment** methods (e.g., limited food lists, portion sizes, and misclassification across diverse cuisines).\n",

    "- **General population**: The entire group of interest (for example, all US adults aged 20+).\n",
    "- **Sample population (target population)**: The subset of the general population that a study *intends* to represent (for example, all registered nurses aged 30–55 in the United States at baseline).\n",
    "- **Study sample**: The actual individuals recruited and measured. This may deviate from the intended target population due to recruitment processes, non-response, and eligibility criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Representativeness\n",
    "A study is **representative** when the distribution of key characteristics in the sample matches that of the population of interest (for example, sex, age, ethnicity, education, socioeconomic position). Lack of representativeness can bias estimates and reduce external validity (generalisation).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recruitment bias (examples)\n",
    "- **“Worried well”**: People who are more health-conscious are more likely to join studies.\n",
    "- **Occupational cohorts**: Often healthier, with higher education and different behaviours than the general public.\n",
    "- **Sex imbalance**: Some studies include only women (e.g., women’s health initiatives) or only men (e.g., certain professional cohorts).\n",
    "- **Under-representation**: Minority groups or lower-income strata may be under-represented.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Addressing bias\n",
    "- **Design stage**: Sampling frames, stratified sampling, oversampling under-represented groups.\n",
    "- **Analysis stage**: **Post-stratification weighting** to align sample distributions to a reference population (e.g., NHANES). Weighting helps for variables captured in the weighting scheme; it cannot fix unmeasured differences.\n"
