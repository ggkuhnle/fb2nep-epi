    "\n",
    "This workbook introduces core ideas in sampling for nutritional epidemiology:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The distinction between the **general population**, a **study's target population**, and the actual **sample**.\n",
    "- The notions of **sampling frames**, **representativeness**, and **sampling error** versus **bias**.\n",
    "- How a **probability sample** such as NHANES can be used as a reference.\n",
    "- How to compare simple descriptive statistics between a **population** and a **sample**.\n",
    "- How **sample size** affects the precision of estimates of central tendency.\n",
    "- Why some famous cohorts (for example, NHS, HPFS) are intentionally **not** representative of all adults.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main example uses **NHANES** demographic data as an approximately nationally representative survey for the United States. For teaching, we treat NHANES as the population, and draw repeated samples from it.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 1.1 General population, target population, and sample\n",
    "\n",
    "- **General population**: The entire group about which we ultimately wish to draw conclusions. For example, “all adults living in the United States”, or “all adults aged 20 years and older in the United Kingdom”.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Target population (study population)**: The subset of the general population that a particular study *intends* to represent. For example, “all registered nurses aged 30–55 years in the United States at baseline”, or “all men aged 40–75 years who are practising health professionals”. This definition is conceptual and exists *before* sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sampling frame**: The operational list or mechanism used to select individuals (for example, a register of residents, a list of employees, a general practitioner list). People who are not in the sampling frame cannot be selected, even if they belong to the target population.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sample**: The actual set of individuals who are recruited and provide data. The sample may differ from the target population because of non-response, exclusion criteria, and practical constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "In nutritional epidemiology, the target population is often broader than the realised sample. The key questions are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Who* did we intend to study?\n",
    "2. *Who* did we actually study?\n",
    "3. How different are these groups with respect to the characteristics that matter for our research question?\n"

    "### 1.2 Representativeness and bias\n",
    "\n",
    "A study sample is **representative** of a population when the distribution of key characteristics in the sample matches that of the population of interest. Examples of such characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sex (for example, proportion female).\n",
    "- Age distribution.\n",
    "- Race and ethnicity.\n",
    "- Education and socioeconomic position.\n",
    "\n",
    "Representativeness is most important for **external validity** (the ability to generalise findings beyond the study sample). Lack of representativeness can lead to **selection bias**, where the association observed in the study differs from the association in the population because of who was included.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is useful to separate:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sampling error**: Random variation in estimates because we observe only a finite sample rather than the whole population. Sampling error becomes smaller as the sample size increases.\n",
    "- **Systematic bias**: Systematic differences between sample and population (for example, non-participation of people with low income) that do not disappear when the sample size increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this workbook, we focus on sampling error and simple aspects of representativeness. More complex selection mechanisms and bias will be addressed later in the module.\n"
