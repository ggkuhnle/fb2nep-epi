    "\n",
    "Version 0.1.0\n",
    "\n",
    "This workbook provides a conceptual introduction to **causal inference** in nutritional epidemiology. The aim is to outline the fundamental ideas that underpin modern approaches, clarify why causal reasoning is essential, and illustrate how these frameworks complement traditional regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "The emphasis here is deliberately **non-technical**: we focus on ideas rather than computation. Wherever examples are used, they draw on the synthetic FB2NEP cohort.\n"

    "## 1. What is causal inference?\n",
    "\n",
    "Epidemiology has always aimed to understand **what causes what**. However, observational data are shaped by complex systems in which exposures, behaviours, environments, and biological processes co-vary. Simple associations rarely answer causal questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Causal inference provides a formal framework to reason about questions such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Does higher sodium intake cause elevated blood pressure?*\n",
    "- *Does long-term physical activity reduce cardiovascular risk?*\n",
    "- *Are associations between dietary patterns and mortality confounded by socioeconomic position?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Two motivations make causal inference indispensable in nutrition:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Interventions matter.** Public health decisions (for example, fortification, reformulation, taxation, guidance) require evidence that modifying an exposure leads to changes in outcomes.\n",
    "2. **Observational data dominate the field.** Because randomised trials are difficult or impossible for most long-term dietary exposures, we rely heavily on cohort and survey data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Causal inference therefore asks: *under what assumptions* can observational contrasts be interpreted as causal? And what methods allow us to approximate the conditions of a randomised trial?\n"

    "## 2. Bradford Hill and the origins of causal reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "Before the development of modern formal theory, Sir Austin Bradford Hill proposed a set of **considerations** for interpreting observed associations in epidemiology. These include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Strength**: large associations are more persuasive.\n",
    "- **Consistency**: findings replicated across populations and designs.\n",
    "- **Specificity**: a single exposure leads to a specific outcome (now recognised as problematic when exposures are multifaceted).\n",
    "- **Temporality**: the cause must precede the effect.\n",
    "- **Biological gradient**: dose–response patterns.\n",
    "- **Plausibility**: coherence with biological understanding.\n",
    "- **Experiment**: evidence from interventions.\n",
    "- **Analogy**: similarity to other known causal relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although not formal criteria, these considerations encourage structured thinking. Modern causal inference builds on the same goal—clarifying when evidence supports a causal interpretation—but replaces heuristics with **explicit assumptions**, **counterfactual reasoning**, and **formal identification conditions**.\n"

    "## 5. Mendelian randomisation (MR) – conceptual overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Mendelian randomisation interprets genetic variants as **instrumental variables**. The key idea is that alleles are randomly allocated at conception, creating a natural experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "MR rests on three assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Relevance:** the genetic variant is associated with the exposure (for example, BMI).\n",
    "2. **Independence:** the variant is not associated with confounders of the exposure–outcome relationship.\n",
    "3. **Exclusion restriction:** the variant affects the outcome only through the exposure (no pleiotropy).\n",
    "\n",
    "In nutritional epidemiology, MR has been applied to questions such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Whether vitamin D affects cardiovascular disease.\n",
    "- Whether lifelong differences in alcohol consumption influence blood pressure.\n",
    "- Whether BMI causally contributes to diabetes and hypertension.\n",
    "\n",
    "We do **not** perform an MR analysis in this workbook. Instead, we highlight that MR can complement observational research when valid instruments exist. However, MR is not a universal solution—pleiotropy, weak instruments, and population structure limit applicability.\n"

Even simple regression attempts to estimate differences in expected potential outcomes, though it relies heavily on assumptions such as no unmeasured confounding.\n"
