    "\n",
    "Traditional health statistics focus on **mortality** — death rates, life expectancy, cause of death. But this misses something important: **morbidity**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider two conditions:\n",
    "- **Ischaemic heart disease**: High mortality, significant disability before death\n",
    "- **Low back pain**: Very low mortality, but affects millions and causes significant suffering\n",
    "\n",
    "If we only count deaths, we systematically undervalue conditions that cause suffering without killing. Summary measures like DALYs and QALYs attempt to capture **both** mortality and morbidity in a single metric.\n",

    "### The Policy Question\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're advising a health ministry with a fixed budget. How do you compare:\n",

    "- Preventing 10,000 cases of chronic low back pain?\n",
    "- Curing 500 cases of blindness?\n",

    "## The GBD reference life table (and why we use it for YLL)\n",
    "\n",
    "When we calculate **Years of Life Lost (YLL)**, we need a benchmark for how many years of life would have been expected *at the age of death*. The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study uses a **reference life table** for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What the life table contains\n",
    "The life table provides the **remaining life expectancy** at different ages.\n",
    "\n",
    "- At age 0, it gives the *expected total length of life at birth* under the reference standard.\n",
    "- At age 40, it gives the *expected additional years of life remaining* for someone who has reached 40.\n",
    "- The values decrease with age because fewer years remain.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we use an abridged version of the reference table (a small set of ages) for simplicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How it is used in YLL\n",
    "For a death at age \\(a\\), YLL uses:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{YLL at age } a = N_a \\times L_a\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $N_a$ is the number of deaths at age $a$\n",
    "- $L_a$ is the **remaining life expectancy** at age $a$ from the reference life table\n",
    "\n",
    "So if the reference table says the remaining life expectancy at age 50 is 35 years, then each death at age 50 contributes **35 YLL**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why use a reference table rather than country-specific life expectancy?\n",
    "Using a single reference life table has a clear purpose: it ensures that a death at a given age is valued consistently, regardless of where it occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If we used country-specific life expectancy, the same death at the same age would generate fewer YLL in countries with lower life expectancy.\n",
    "- That can be defended descriptively (“that is what is observed locally”), but it embeds a strong normative assumption (“a year of life is worth less in some places”).\n",
    "\n",
    "GBD’s choice is therefore partly ethical: it reflects an idea of **equal potential longevity**, rather than local averages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important interpretation\n",
    "The reference life table is **not** a prediction of how long a particular person would have lived.\n",
    "It is a standard used for accounting, so that YLL is comparable across populations and over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use this table throughout the notebook whenever we calculate YLL.\n"

    "## Disability weights (DW): what they mean — and what they do not\n",
    "\n",
    "A **disability weight (DW)** quantifies how far a given health state falls short of full health.\n",
    "\n",
    "- DW = 0 means full health  \n",
    "- DW = 1 means a health state equivalent to death  \n",
    "\n",
    "Disability weights are therefore **not probabilities**, **not risks**, and **not measures of severity in a clinical sense**. They are scaling factors used to convert time lived in a health state into **healthy-equivalent years lost**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How DW enters the YLD calculation\n",
    "In the prevalence-based formulation used here:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{YLD} = \\text{Prevalence} \\times \\text{DW}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If 10,000 people live for one year with a condition that has DW = 0.20, this corresponds to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 10,000 years lived in that state, but\n",
    "- 2,000 **healthy-equivalent years lost** in that year.\n",
    "\n",
    "The remaining 8,000 years are interpreted as healthy-equivalent years lived.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What disability weights represent\n",
    "A disability weight answers the question:\n",
    "\n",
    "> *“How much healthy life is lost while living in this health state, relative to full health?”*\n",
    "\n",
    "It does **not** answer:\n",
    "- how frightening the condition is,\n",
    "- how unacceptable it feels morally,\n",
    "- how likely it is to lead to death,\n",
    "- how much society should care about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Those considerations enter policy decisions elsewhere — not in the DW itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disability weights and death\n",
    "Disability weights apply **only to time spent alive**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Losses due to **premature death** are captured separately through **Years of Life Lost (YLL)**.\n",
    "- As a result, highly lethal diseases with short symptomatic phases (e.g. Ebola, rabies) often have **moderate disability weights**, but very large YLL.\n",
    "- Chronic, non-fatal conditions can generate large YLD despite low or zero mortality.\n",
    "\n",
    "This separation is intentional and central to the DALY framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why disability weights are bounded between 0 and 1\n",
    "In DALYs, disability weights are restricted to the interval [0, 1].\n",
    "\n",
    "- Some valuation systems used in QALYs allow states to be valued as *worse than death* (negative utilities).\n",
    "- The GBD framework does **not** allow negative values; a state equivalent to death has DW = 1, and no state exceeds this.\n",
    "\n",
    "This design choice avoids certain ethical and interpretive problems, but it also imposes limits on what the DW scale can express.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next section, we examine **how disability weights are elicited**, and why different methods (VAS, TTO, standard gamble) often produce systematically different values.\n"

    "\n",
    "The Global Burden of Disease study uses **paired comparisons** from population surveys. Respondents are presented with two hypothetical health states and asked which they consider healthier.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2 Other elicitation methods (and why they differ)\n",
    "\n",
    "Different elicitation methods often produce systematically different values for the same health state.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Visual analogue scale (VAS):** respondents place a health state on a line (for example 0 = death, 100 = full health). This is simple, but it is sensitive to anchoring and does not enforce an explicit trade-off.\n",
    "- **Time trade-off (TTO):** respondents trade length of life for quality of life (for example, 10 years in a health state is equivalent to *x* years in full health). This enforces a quantity–quality trade, but results depend on the time horizon and attitudes to death.\n",
    "- **Standard gamble (SG):** respondents choose between a certain impaired health state and a gamble between full health and immediate death. This incorporates risk and is influenced by risk aversion.\n",
    "- **Person trade-off (PTO):** respondents trade benefits across people (for example, curing 100 people of A versus curing *y* people of B). This resembles policy choices but mixes severity with moral judgements about distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Utilities and negative values:** in some QALY valuation systems, a health state can be valued as worse than death, producing negative utilities. Disability weights used in DALYs are bounded between 0 and 1; they do not take negative values.\n",
