    "# FB2NEP Workbook 7 – Confounding, DAGs, and Causal Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Version 0.0.6\n",
    "\n",
    "This workbook builds on Workbook 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Workbook 6, we treated regression as a practical tool for estimating associations\n",
    "between an exposure and an outcome, and we focused on model types (linear, logistic,\n",
    "Cox), assumptions, diagnostics, and basic interpretation of coefficients (β, OR, RR, HR).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this workbook, we move from **association** to **causal thinking**. We introduce:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Confounders.\n",
    "- Colliders.\n",
    "- Mediators.\n",
    "- Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) as a way to formalise causal assumptions.\n",
    "- Approaches to adjustment (stratification and regression).\n",
    "- The special role of **energy intake** in nutritional epidemiology.\n",
    "- A brief introduction to **counterfactual** thinking.\n",
    "\n",
    "A more formal treatment of causal inference, including modern notation and methods,\n",
    "is given in **Workbook 9**. Here we focus on intuition and on how causal structure\n",
    "affects regression analyses in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the synthetic *FB2NEP cohort* throughout. The precise variable names may\n",
    "differ slightly from those used here; if you obtain an error (for example, `KeyError`),\n",
    "carefully check the column names of the dataset and adapt the code accordingly."

    "\n",
    "In nutritional epidemiology, **total energy intake** (for example, `energy_kcal`)\n",
    "is not a classical confounder in the usual sense. Instead, it is a kind of\n",
    "“scaling” variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Individuals who eat **more total energy** tend to consume more of many nutrients\n",
    "  and foods simply because they eat more food.\n",
    "- Many nutrients are also biologically related to energy intake (for example,\n",
    "  higher energy intake is often associated with higher body size and physical\n",
    "  activity).\n",
    "\n",
    "If we ignore total energy intake, we may incorrectly attribute the effect of\n",
    "“eating more food overall” to a specific nutrient or food.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2 Common energy-adjustment methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Several approaches are used to adjust nutrient intakes for total energy:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Nutrient density method**\n",
    "   - Express the nutrient per unit of energy, for example g/MJ or % of energy.\n",
    "   - Example: grams of fibre per 10 MJ.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Residual method**\n",
    "   - Regress the nutrient of interest on total energy intake.\n",
    "   - Use the **residuals** (observed minus expected nutrient intake given energy)\n",
    "     as an energy-adjusted exposure.\n",
    "   - This removes the part of the nutrient intake that is explained by total\n",
    "     energy intake.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Energy-adjusted models**\n",
    "   - Include both the nutrient and total energy intake as covariates in the\n",
    "     regression model of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each method has advantages and disadvantages. The residual method and energy-adjusted\n",
    "models are particularly useful when working with food-frequency questionnaires (FFQs),\n",
    "where measurement error and strong correlations between nutrients can be substantial.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.3 Special case of FFQs\n",
    "\n",
    "FFQs typically record **relative** frequencies of consumption over long periods.\n",
    "Reported intakes of many foods and nutrients are highly correlated, and systematic\n",
    "measurement error is common. Adjusting for total energy intake can:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reduce measurement error that is common to many foods (for example, general\n",
    "  over-reporting or under-reporting).\n",
    "- Focus analyses on **diet composition** rather than total amount of food.\n"

    "### Interpreting the mediation example (salt and SBP)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this synthetic dataset you will typically find that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **crude OR** for `salt_g_d` is close to 1 (weak or no association).\n",
    "- The **SBP-adjusted OR** is also close to 1, sometimes slightly below or above.\n",
    "\n",
    "This reflects how the data generator was constructed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Salt has a **small direct effect** on CVD.\n",
    "- Most of the effect of salt operates through **SBP**.\n",
    "- When we adjust for SBP, we remove the mediation pathway and focus on the direct effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though the numerical effect is small, the example illustrates the key conceptual point:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If our target is the **total effect** of salt on CVD, we should *not* adjust for SBP.\n",
    "- If our target is the **direct effect** of salt, holding SBP constant, then we should\n",
    "  adjust for SBP, but we must interpret the result as a direct effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is different from the confounding example with `SES_class`, where adjustment\n",
    "reduces bias in estimating the causal effect of physical activity on CVD.\n"

    "\n",
    "The key message is not the exact shape of the curve, but the **change of estimand**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- By conditioning on SBP, we are no longer looking at the total effect of salt\n",
    "  on CVD, but at the risk pattern **given equal SBP**.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Different models answer different causal questions. Prediction curves are useful\n",
    "> for visualising these differences, but they must always be interpreted in the\n",
