        "**Strengths**\n",
        "- Simple, widely recognised, consistently used in UK surveys.\n",
        "- Shows clear associations with health behaviours and outcomes.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Limitations**\n",
        "- Coarse: mixes diverse occupations within broad categories.\n",
        "- Not portable outside the UK (occupation structures differ).\n",
        "- Based on *occupation*, which is awkward for students, retirees, carers, and precarious workers.\n",
        "- Does not map neatly to education or income.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. Harmonisation Issues Across Datasets (Education, Income, Occupation)\n",
        "\n",
        "SES looks deceptively simple, but different datasets measure **different things**:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **NHANES (US)** uses *education* (≤ high school / some college / college+).\n",
        "- **NDNS (UK)** often uses education or income *alongside* NRS social grade.\n",
        "- **EPIC** and **UK Biobank** use mixtures of *occupation*, *education*, *income*, *area-level deprivation*.\n",
        "- **FB2NEP** uses *occupation-based social grades* (ABC1 / C2DE).\n",
        "- **International surveys** (OECD, WHO STEPS, Eurostat) usually use education because occupation and income do not translate across countries.\n",
        "\n",
        "This immediately creates problems for harmonisation.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Why SES ≠ education ≠ income ≠ occupation\n",
        "\n",
        "SES is a **latent construct** — an underlying social position that cannot be measured directly.  \n",
        "Different operationalisations capture different aspects:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Education** → long-term human capital, cognitive resources, health literacy.  \n",
        "- **Income** → current material resources and capacity to purchase goods.  \n",
        "- **Occupation** → job security, working conditions, prestige, social capital.  \n",
        "- **Area-level deprivation** → neighbourhood environment, access to services.\n",
        "\n",
        "These correlate, but not perfectly.  \n",
        "> Example: a highly educated PhD student may have low income; a long-serving electrician may earn more than a junior academic but be coded as C2, not ABC1.\n",
        "\n",
        "Using one variable to stand in for SES always loses information.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Why the UK is unusual\n",
        "\n",
        "The UK has a long-standing, highly standardised **occupation-based SES system**:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **NRS Social Grades (A–E)**, created for media and market research, became widely used in public health research.\n",
        "- It maps occupation → social class → purchasing power in a historically industrial society.\n",
        "- It remains deeply embedded in UK survey infrastructure (ONS, NDNS, IPSOS, BBC, etc.).\n",
        "\n",
        "This is unusual internationally:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Most countries **do not** have a national occupation-based SES scale.\n",
        "- Education is the default SES variable in the US, EU, and WHO datasets because it is the most stable and portable across contexts.\n",
        "- Occupations, job structures and prestige systems differ too much between countries to harmonise consistently.\n",
        "\n",
        "Thus, using ABC1/C2DE outside the UK is difficult.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### What happens when two SES systems must be aligned?\n",
        "\n",
        "Any harmonisation requires **strong assumptions**.  \n",
        "Typical problems:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Different constructs**: NHANES education ≠ UK NRS grades.  \n",
        "- **Different number of categories**: one is binary (ABC1/C2DE), one has three or six categories.  \n",
        "- **Different conceptual meaning**: \"College+\" is not equivalent to \"professional/managerial\".  \n",
        "- **Non-monotonic relationships**: more education ≠ higher job grade in every case.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example mismatches:\n",
        "- A retired senior civil servant → NRS A/B but education may be “≤ High school”.\n",
        "- A university graduate in a temporary low-paid job → college+ + C2 or D.\n",
        "- A tradesperson with high income → C2 but with higher income than many ABC1 workers.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Implications for analysis\n",
        "\n",
        "Harmonisation is always an approximation.  \n",
        "When aligning SES across datasets:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Be explicit** about the mapping rules you apply.  \n",
        "- **Check frequencies** and identify categories that map poorly.  \n",
        "- **Document data loss** (e.g. collapsing categories removes nuance).  \n",
        "- **Acknowledge uncertainty** introduced by any recoding.  \n",
        "- **Perform sensitivity analyses** where possible (e.g., different mapping schemes).\n",
        "\n",
        "Teaching takeaway:  \n",
        "*SES is a theoretical construct, not a variable.  \n",
        "Every dataset measures it differently.  \n",
        "Harmonisation therefore requires judgement, transparency, and a clear statement of limitations.*\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. Takeaway\n",
        "\n",
        "SES is not a single “true” attribute.  \n",
        "Different countries, surveys and traditions measure it differently.  \n",
        "For cross-dataset comparisons (e.g. NHANES vs FB2NEP), SES must be **translated** with care and the uncertainties should be stated clearly.\n",

        "\n",
        "In nutritional epidemiology, a recurring question is whether **reported energy intake (EI)** is\n",
        "compatible with the **energy a person is expected to expend**.  \n",
        "The **Goldberg cut-off** is a widely used, reproducible approach to detect *implausible*\n",
        "self-reported energy intakes.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 1. Core idea\n",
        "\n",
        "The method compares:\n",
        "\n",
        "\\[\n",
        "\\frac{EI}{EE}\n",
        "\\]\n",
        "\n",
        "where **EE** is the *minimum* energy expenditure expected for that person.\n",
        "\n",
        "If the ratio is *too low*, the individual is likely to be an **under-reporter**.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2. Steps in the Goldberg method\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Estimate Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)**  \n",
        "   Usually via predictive equations (Schofield, Henry, or similar) using:\n",
        "   - age  \n",
        "   - sex  \n",
        "   - weight (and occasionally height)\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Assume a minimum plausible Physical Activity Level (PAL)**  \n",
        "   A typical assumption is **PAL = 1.55** for a “sedentary to lightly active” lifestyle.  \n",
        "   This gives the minimum Total Energy Expenditure (TEE):\n",
        "\n",
        "   \\[\n",
        "   \\text{TEE}_{\\min} = \\text{BMR} \\times \\text{PAL}\n",
        "   \\]\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Compute the Goldberg ratio**\n",
        "\n",
        "   \\[\n",
        "   r = \\frac{\\text{Reported EI}}{\\text{TEE}_{\\min}}\n",
        "   \\]\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Compare the ratio to a cut-off**\n",
        "\n",
        "   A common lower limit is **0.76–0.80**, derived by combining:\n",
        "   - day-to-day variation in energy intake,\n",
        "   - variation in BMR prediction,\n",
        "   - sampling duration.\n",
        "\n",
        "   If \\( r < \\text{cut-off} \\), the intake is considered **implausibly low**.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3. Interpretation\n",
        "\n",
        "The rule does *not* say the individual is deliberately misreporting.  \n",
        "It indicates that the **reported intake is statistically incompatible** with sustaining\n",
        "basic physiological requirements over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "Examples:\n",
        "- A reported EI of **900 kcal/day** for a healthy adult is implausible.  \n",
        "- A physically active person reporting 1,200 kcal/day may also be flagged.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 4. Why the Goldberg cut-off is widely used\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Transparent** and fully formula-based.  \n",
        "- **Simple** and implementable in any dataset.  \n",
        "- **Consistent** across studies.  \n",
        "- Helps identify **outliers** before modelling.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, the method is designed for population-level plausibility screening, **not** as a\n",
        "diagnostic tool for individual behaviour.\n",

        "### 4.5 Limitations of the Goldberg Cut-off\n",
        "\n",
        "Although influential, the Goldberg approach has important limitations:\n",
        "\n",
        "#### (a) Strong assumptions about PAL  \n",
        "Using a fixed PAL (for example 1.55) ignores the wide variation in physical activity\n",
        "between individuals.  \n",
        "TEE may be substantially higher or lower than assumed, causing:\n",
        "- *false positives* (flagged as under-reporting but plausible),  \n",
        "- *false negatives* (severe under-reporting may not be flagged if activity is low).\n",
        "\n",
        "#### (b) BMR prediction error  \n",
        "Predictive equations for BMR introduce error:\n",
        "- ±5–10% for many individuals,\n",
        "- larger for those with atypical body composition.\n",
        "\n",
        "If BMR is misestimated, the Goldberg ratio becomes misleading.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### (c) One-day (or few-day) intake is **not** habitual intake  \n",
        "Short-term 24-h recalls show **large day-to-day variation**, making the ratio unstable.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### (d) Cannot distinguish *intentional dieting*  \n",
        "Low reported intakes may reflect:\n",
        "- short-term restriction,\n",
        "- illness,\n",
        "- poor recall,\n",
        "- dieting behaviour.\n",
        "\n",
        "The cut-off treats all as “implausible”.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### (e) Systematic bias in self-reporting  \n",
        "Energy misreporting is **not random**:\n",
        "- overweight individuals tend to under-report energy, especially snacks and high-fat foods;\n",
        "- some demographic groups systematically under- or over-report.\n",
        "\n",
        "Thus the Goldberg decision can itself **introduce bias**, for example:\n",
        "- removing more participants with high BMI,\n",
        "- altering diet–BMI or diet–disease associations.\n",
        "\n",
        "This concern is highlighted in recent evaluation studies.\n",

        "**“Energy intake and expenditure in doubly labelled water studies worldwide”**  \n",
        "provides an updated perspective:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Doubly labelled water (DLW) studies show **large inter-individual variation in TEE**, wider than commonly assumed in Goldberg calculations.\n",
        "- Habitual EI is often **higher than self-reported**, but misreporting varies by age, sex, BMI and cultural context.\n",
        "- The study stresses that **physiological variation is larger** than the Goldberg framework assumes.\n",
        "- Therefore, using a universal PAL and narrow cut-offs may systematically misclassify valid data.\n",
        "\n",
        "This supports a broader consensus that:\n",
